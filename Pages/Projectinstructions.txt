💡 Web Page Flow Strategy: Clean, Scrollable, Scannable
1. Hero Section (Top of the Page)
Purpose: Grab attention, set the tone.

Project Title

One-sentence description of the project

Key value or impact (what problem it solves)

Optional: A screenshot, demo button, or short tagline

💡 Think of it like a LinkedIn post hook or the “elevator pitch” for your project.

2. Quick Overview (Summary Section)
Purpose: Let visitors know what they'll learn if they scroll.

Mini bullet list or icons:

🚀 Goal

🧠 Technologies used

⏱️ Timeline

📈 Outcome

This acts like a table of contents in visual form — concise and clickable if you want to use anchor links.

3. Context & Objectives
Purpose: Explain the why.

What was the initial demand or problem?

Who was it for (real or hypothetical)?

What were the objectives?

💡 Use visuals, icons, or side notes to break text and make it digestible.

4. Specifications / Features
Purpose: Show your planning and scope thinking.

Main functional features (small cards or blocks)

Tools or technologies you chose and why

Link to cahier des charges as a downloadable PDF or collapsible section

💡 You don’t need to show all requirements — just a few to show depth, with the rest available on click.

5. Design & Development
Purpose: Talk briefly about your process.

Sketches / mockups (if any)

Technical architecture or structure (maybe a diagram)

Dev methodology (Agile steps, Kanban board screenshot, etc.)

Link to GitHub repo

💡 Employers love to see the reasoning behind your choices, not just the result.

6. Timeline & Roadmap
Purpose: Show that you planned ahead.

Visual timeline (can be simple horizontal bar)

Key milestones (mockup, MVP, testing, deployment)

Mention challenges or pivots if relevant

7. Risk Handling / Lessons Learned
Purpose: Show that you reflect and improve.

One or two risks you identified and handled

Problems you faced and how you solved them

What you would do differently next time

💡 This section adds a lot of maturity to your profile, and employers notice that.

8. Demo & Final Result
Purpose: The payoff.

Screenshots or a working live demo link

GIFs or short videos if you want to keep it inline

Summary of what was accomplished

9. Conclusion / Call to Action
Purpose: Leave a lasting impression.

What did you gain from the project?

Invite feedback or say how it connects to your career goals

Contact link or link to your portfolio/resume

📌 Optional Enhancements
Floating nav bar or side index for long pages

Light/dark mode toggle
